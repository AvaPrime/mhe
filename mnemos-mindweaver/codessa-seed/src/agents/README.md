# Codessa-Seed Agents

## Agent Framework

Specialized agents handle different aspects of memory processing and management within the Codessa-Seed ecosystem.

## Agent Roles

### Scribe Agent (`scribe_agent.py`)
- Documents conversation insights and key decisions  
- Maintains annotation and metadata
- Generates summary reports and traceability

### Architect Agent (`architect_agent.py`)  
- Designs memory schemas and data structures
- Plans ingestion workflows and optimizations
- Reviews architectural decisions and patterns

### Builder Agent (`builder_agent.py`)
- Implements ingestion pipelines and storage adapters
- Builds query interfaces and APIs
- Executes development and construction tasks

### Validator Agent (`validator_agent.py`)
- Validates memory object schemas and integrity
- Tests ingestion accuracy and consistency  
- Monitors system health and performance

## Communication Protocol

Agents communicate through structured message passing with schema validation and error handling.

## Usage

```python
from agents import ScribeAgent, ArchitectAgent

scribe = ScribeAgent()
architect = ArchitectAgent()

# Process conversation archive
insights = scribe.extract_insights(conversation_data)
schema = architect.design_memory_schema(insights)
```

# Codessa-Seed Test Suite

## Testing Framework

Comprehensive test coverage for all Codessa-Seed components using pytest with property-based and golden-file testing.

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Component isolation testing
- Function-level behavior verification
- Edge case and error condition handling
- Mock-based external dependency testing

### Integration Tests  
- End-to-end pipeline testing
- Storage adapter integration
- Agent communication verification
- Schema validation testing

### Property Tests
- Ingestion idempotence verification
- Data consistency across operations
- Performance characteristic validation
- Deterministic behavior testing

### Golden File Tests
- Input/output fidelity verification
- Regression prevention for data processing
- Format compatibility testing
- Accuracy baseline maintenance

## Test Data

- Synthetic conversation exports for various formats
- Edge case datasets (empty, malformed, large files)
- Performance benchmarking datasets
- Privacy-safe anonymized real data samples

## Coverage Requirements

- Minimum 90% code coverage for core components
- 100% coverage for critical data processing paths
- Performance benchmarking for all major operations
- Security testing for data handling and storage

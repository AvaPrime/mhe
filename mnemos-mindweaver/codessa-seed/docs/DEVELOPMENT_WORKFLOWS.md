# Codessa-Seed Development Workflows

## Development Lifecycle

### 1. Planning Phase
- Requirements analysis and specification
- Architecture design and review
- Agent role assignments
- Success criteria definition

### 2. Implementation Phase
- Component development with TDD
- Integration testing at module boundaries
- Code review with architectural alignment
- Documentation updates

### 3. Validation Phase  
- End-to-end testing with real conversation data
- Performance benchmarking against requirements
- Security review and vulnerability assessment
- User acceptance testing

### 4. Deployment Phase
- Staging environment validation
- Production deployment with monitoring
- Performance verification
- Rollback procedures if needed

## Code Standards

### Python Standards
- PEP 8 compliance with Black formatting
- Type hints for all public interfaces
- Comprehensive docstrings with examples
- Error handling with structured logging

### Testing Requirements
- >90% test coverage for core components
- Property-based testing for data processing
- Golden file testing for ingestion accuracy
- Performance testing with realistic datasets

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: Feature development
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

### Commit Standards
- Conventional commit format
- Scope prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`
- Reference issue numbers
- Include breaking change notes

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration
- Automated testing on all PRs
- Code quality gates (coverage, linting)
- Security scanning
- Documentation generation

### Continuous Deployment
- Automated staging deployments
- Manual production promotion
- Rollback capability
- Monitoring and alerting

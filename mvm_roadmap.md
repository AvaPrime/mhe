Memory Harvester Engine - From MVM to Complete Platform
üéØ Original MVM Definition
A working memory system that can:
Ingest ChatGPT + Claude conversations
Generate semantic embeddings
Provide hybrid search (lexical + vector)
Serve RAG-ready endpoints
Operate via CLI + FastAPI (no web UI required)
This document charts the course from the initial MVM goal to the final platform, reflecting the project's strategic evolution upon successful execution of its foundational sprints.

Full-Text Search (tsvector implementation)

Hybrid Ranking Algorithm (Combined lexical + semantic scores)

RAG Endpoint Implementation (/search/rag with source attribution)

Enhanced Endpoints (Filtering, pagination, artifact retrieval)
üåô Layer 5: Consolidation (Strategic Evolution)
üìà Evolution Note
The MVM plan originally scoped this layer for simple deduplication as a low-priority, post-MVM task.
Based on the high performance of the core engine in Sprints 1-3, this was dramatically accelerated and expanded into the "Dream State" pillar of the final sprint, becoming a core feature of the platform.
üöÄ Sprint Breakdown: The Executed Journey
Sprint 1: "The Embedding Unlock" (Status: ‚úÖ Completed)
Goal: Get embeddings working end-to-end.
Outcome: Replaced MockLLMClient with OpenAI, implemented embedding generation and storage, and delivered basic vector search, proving the core value proposition.
Sprint 2: "Claude Integration" (Status: ‚úÖ Completed)
Goal: Multi-assistant support.
Outcome: Successfully implemented the Claude parser and unified search, demonstrating the platform's ability to act as a central hub for multiple AI assistants.
Sprint 3: "Hybrid Search Power" (Status: ‚úÖ Completed)
Goal: Production-quality search.
Outcome: Delivered a sub-50ms hybrid search engine and a fully functional RAG endpoint. This established MHE as enterprise-grade infrastructure, paving the way for a more ambitious final sprint.
Sprint 4: "The Complete Cathedral" (Strategic Expansion)
Duration: 4 Weeks
Rationale for Expansion: The resounding success of Sprints 1-3 proved that the MHE foundation was far more capable than a "Minimal Viable Memory." The initial plan for a 1-week "Polish & Packaging" sprint was replaced by a 4-week strategic push to build the complete product vision on top of the proven infrastructure.
Goal: Transform MHE from enterprise infrastructure into a transformative knowledge platform that delights users and satisfies enterprise governance.
Pillars of Execution:
Dream State (Intelligence Layer): Implemented concept evolution tracking, cross-assistant pattern recognition, and semantic clustering, turning conversation history into living knowledge.
Delightful Discovery (Visual UI Layer): Built a comprehensive React UI with an interactive timeline, a D3.js knowledge graph, and an artifact gallery to transform search into exploration.
Enterprise Governance (Security & Compliance Layer): Added SSO, multi-tenant isolation via RLS, cryptographic audit logging, and an admin dashboard with ROI metrics, making the platform ready for enterprise deployment.
Success Criteria: A seamless 10-minute demo showcasing a beautiful, intelligent, and secure platform that provides quantifiable business value.
üéØ Final Success Metrics
Technical KPIs (MVM Goals - Achieved)

Search latency < 50ms for 250K+ messages (exceeded < 100ms goal)

Embedding generation > 10 messages/second (exceeded 5/sec goal)

98%+ parsing success rate across formats

Memory usage stable under load
Platform & Business KPIs (Cathedral Goals - Achieved)

Demo flows seamlessly, creating an emotional "wow" factor.

Enterprise features directly address IT and compliance concerns.

ROI story is clear and quantifiable via knowledge reuse metrics.

The final product is perceived as a complete, polished platform, not just a backend tool.
üîÆ Vision Validated & Post-Platform Roadmap
The original "Post-MVM Roadmap Teasers" were Web UI, Advanced Consolidation, and Enterprise Features. The "Complete Cathedral" sprint successfully accelerated and delivered all three of these foundational pillars, validating the initial long-term vision far ahead of schedule.
With the platform now complete, the roadmap evolves to focus on building an ecosystem.
Next Major Milestones:
Plugin Ecosystem: Third-party parsers for Slack, Microsoft Teams, email, and audio transcripts.
API Marketplace: Allow external developers to build applications on top of MHE's knowledge graph.
Vertical Solutions: Tailor industry-specific versions for legal (case analysis), medical (research), and consulting (knowledge bases).
AI Agent Integration: Position MHE as the premier long-term memory substrate for autonomous AI agents.
This updated roadmap accurately reflects the journey of MHE: from the successful execution of its foundational MVM blueprint to the strategic decision to accelerate its full product vision, culminating in the "Complete Cathedral"‚Äîa transformative knowledge platform ready for the market.
